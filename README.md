# Python-Programming-Paradigms

2025 Fall SKKU - Programming Language class

Based on programming language lecture and python concepts, I implemented them in python for assignmnet.

**1. Adventurer's Guild System Game**

Using Parameter binding, closure, user-defined overloaded operators, the game should be run appropriately.

**2. Parse Tree**

This assignment goal is implementing parse tree in recursive way. (The error exists, so still modifying)

**3. Printing Receipt**

Python is object-oriented programming language, so using self variable, constructor, encapsulation(private), polymorphism to print customer's receipt.
